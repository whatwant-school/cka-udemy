##  How many PODs exist on the system?

```
> kubectl get pods
```

### How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?

```
> kubectl get replicasets
```

### How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see?

```
> kubectl get replicasets
```

### DESIRE

### What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?

```
> kubectl describe replicasets new-replica-set
```

### How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set?

```
> kubectl get replicasets
```

### Why do you think the PODs are not ready?

```
> kubectl describe pods new-replica-set-75c2x
```

### Delete any one of the 4 PODs

```
> kubectl delete pods new-replica-set-75c2x
```

### How many PODs exist now?

```
> kubectl get pods
```

### Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one?

### Create a ReplicaSet using the 'replicaset-definition-1.yaml' file located at /root/

```
> cd /root
> vi ./replicaset-definition-1.yaml
```

- fix : `apiVersion: v1` → `apiVersion: apps/v1`

```
> kubectl create -f replicaset-definition-1.yaml
> kubectl get replicasets
```

### Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.

```
> cd /root
> vi ./replicaset-definition-2.yaml
```
- fix : `tier: nginx` → `tier: frontend`

```
> kubectl create -f replicaset-definition-2.yaml
> kubectl get replicasets
```

### Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2

```
> kubectl delete replicasets replicaset-1
> kubectl delete replicasets replicaset-2
> kubectl get replicasets
```

### Fix the original replica set 'new-replica-set' to use the correct 'busybox' image

```
> kubectl edit replicasets new-replica-set
```

- fix : `image: busybox777` → `image: busybox`

```
> kubectl delete pods new-replica-set-88p8n
> kubectl delete pods new-replica-set-888x
> kubectl delete pods new-replica-set-88xx
> kubectl delete pods new-replica-set-8xxx
> kubectl get pods
```

### Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs

```
> kubectl scale --replicas=5 replicaset new-replica-set
> kubectl get pods
```

### Now scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs

```
> kubectl scale --replicas=2 replicaset new-replica-set
> kubectl get pods
```
